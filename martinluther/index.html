<p>
Luther's father was determined to see Luther become a lawyer so to start he sent him to a Latin School in Mansfield. Later Luther went to a school in Magdeburg operated by the Brethren of the Common Life, he later compared his life there to hell. In 1501, at the age of 17 he entered the University of Erfurt, where he took a course in liberal arts and received a baccalaureate degree in 1502. In 1505 he earned his masters degree. Luther took a course in law but dropped out shortly after because he belived law represented unsureness. On July 2nd, 1505, on his way back to the university a lightning bolt struck near him and in fear he yelled "Help! Saint Anna, I will become a monk!" He took his cry as a vow and left the university for the St. Augustine's Monastery in Erfurt on July 17th, 1505.

<h3 style="background-color:#f27b05;">The Reformation</h1>

<p>
In 1517, as a professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg Luther wrote the 95 Theses. The 95 Theses attacked the Catholic Church's sale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence">Indulgences</a>. The 95 Theses also put forward two beliefs, 1. that the Bible is the central religious authority and 2. that humans may reach salvation only by their faith and not by their deeds. Copies of the 95 Theses made their way around Germany and the rest of Europe. In July of 1520, Pope Leo X issued a public decree that said Luther's writing was heretical and forced Luther to recant in Rome, Luther refused to recant so the Pope excommunicated him from the Catholic Church. In April of 1521 Luther appeared before the Diet of Worms, after refusing to recant once again he concluded with the statement "Here I stand. God help me. I can do no other." In May, the Holy Roman emperor Charles V ordered Luther's writings to be burned. By late 1521 the reform had grown beyond Luther's control and it started getting more political; leaders of nations started leading the reform.

<p>
By 1531 Luther had been suffering from many health issues such as Ménière's disease, vertigo, fainting, tinnitus, and a cataract. The years leading up to his death in 1546 his health had deteriorated even futher where he developed kidney and bladder stones, athritis, and angina. Luther's last journey was to Mansfield because of his concern for his sibling's families still continuing Luther's father's copper refining business. They were being threatened by Count Albrecht of Mansfield who wanted to take the industry under his own control. The negotiations regarding the industry were concluded on February 17th, 1546. Later that night Luther died from a stroke.
