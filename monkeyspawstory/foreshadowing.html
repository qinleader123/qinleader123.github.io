<h2>Foreshadowing</h2>
<strong><mark>NOTE: all quotes are direct quotes from the story.</mark></strong> 
<p>(Sergeant Morris) "he wanted to show that fate ruled peoples lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow." This quote forshadowes to the later part of the story but the rest of the characters don't listen because they are distracted by the paw.</p>
