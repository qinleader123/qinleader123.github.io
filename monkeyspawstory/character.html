<h2>Character</h2>
<strong><mark>NOTE: all quotes are direct quotes from the story.</mark></strong> 
<h3>Protagonist/Antagonist</h3>
<p>Mr. White is the Protagonist. Evidence: (Mr. White) "I wish for two hundered pounds" Mr. White uses the Monkey's Paw without realizing the consequences he will deal with later. Mr. White deals with the drama or in this case, the consequences, so he is the Protagonist.</p>
<p>Sergeant-Major Morris is the antagonist. Evidence: Sergeant Morris lets Mr. White have the paw for (Mr. White) "a trifle."</p>   
<h3>Static/Dynamic</h3>
<p>Mr. White is dynamic because he realizes (later in the story) that the purpose of the paw was that people who mess with fate have to deal with the consequences. Evidence: (Mr. White) "For God's sake, dont let it in" Mr. White knows that "it" is not the son Mrs. White was hoping to see. 
<p>Mrs. White is static because she does not get what the purpose of the paw is, "it" is probably not the son she wants to see. Evidence: (Mrs. White) "you're afraid of your own son."</p>
