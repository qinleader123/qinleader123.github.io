<h2>Mood</h2>
<strong><mark>NOTE: all quotes are direct quotes from the story.</mark></strong> 
<p>The mood is mysterious. Evidence: (Narrator) "the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnam Villa..." (Sergeant Morris) "it had a spell put on it by an old fakir" the mood is created by the weather and the mysteriousness of the monkey's paw.</p>
